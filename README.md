# 157A Project: League Management Database
### Pio Romo, Simon Truong

##### Project Overview
<p> The Basketball League Management System is an application that allows you to organize a league by teams, host matches to display wins and losses, 
  and read about an individual playerâ€™s statistics. This is relevant because there is no obvious tool that helps organize all of this information neatly and efficiently, 
  so we developed our own. </p>

##### Project Set-Up
1. Before we get started, we need to ensure we have the proper software and dependencies to run this project.<br>
   - This project requires the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. <br>
     You can download here: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-09/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-and-web-developers
   - This project also requires Apache Tomcat in order to run. We use Tomcat v9.0.89 for this project, <br>
     but any version within Tomcat v9.0.xx should work just fine. You can download here: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
   - This project of course requires both Java and mySQL. Ensure your device contains a JDK, as well as mySQL. <br>
     We use mySQL from the terminal, but you can also use the workbench if you like. Make note of your username and password!
   - Lastly, the  project requires a mySQL connector/ JDBC. This project uses version 9.0.0. <br>
     You can download here: https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-j/
     
   > For now, just download the software. We'll show you how to configure it next!
   
2. OK! Now that you've downloaded what's needed, the first step is to clone our repository. <br>
   Open your terminal and run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/PioRomo/157AProject.git`
3. Open Eclipse and import the project. Select **File > Import**. <br>
   In the Import Wizard, click **General > Existing Projects Into Workspace**
Any additional configuration steps needed to connect to the database
