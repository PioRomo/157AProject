# 157A Project: League Management Database
### Pio Romo, Simon Truong

##### Project Overview
<p> The Basketball League Management System is an application that allows you to organize a league by teams, host matches to display wins and losses, 
  and read about an individual playerâ€™s statistics. This is relevant because there is no obvious tool that helps organize all of this information neatly and efficiently, 
  so we developed our own. </p>

##### Project Set-Up
